# Learning_management
This is a short demo project I have built in python to demonstrate the working principle of Learning management system.
There is no UI I have created. It is completely command line based project. I am trying to improve in it to make it realistic once it will completed will try to deploy with UI for real use.

# Instruction to Run
1. Install python3
2. clone the project file
3. Go to command prompt or Terminal
4. Go to project directory
5. execute python3 Main.py
6. Further you will move ahead according to the instruction.
Any improvement suggessions will always be appreciated.
